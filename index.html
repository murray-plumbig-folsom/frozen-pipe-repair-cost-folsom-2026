      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Frozen pipe repair cost is a scope-based topic that reflects what is required to locate a freeze-affected line, restore safe operation, and confirm the plumbing system remains sound after cold exposure. In practice, freezing can restrict flow and create expansion stress at joints and fittings, which may not be obvious until the system is re-pressurized. A technical view therefore considers both the immediate damaged segment and adjacent connections that experienced the same thermal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Folsom, freeze-related concerns most often involve localized cold zones rather than uniform building temperature. Garages, crawl spaces, exterior-wall runs, and penetrations around hose bibs can cool quickly during cold overnight periods. Because neighborhoods include a mix of construction eras and remodeling patterns, pipe routing and insulation continuity can vary widely, changing the amount of access and verification required for a complete repair.

  <section aria-label="Process and diagnostics">
    <h2>Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>
      Technical evaluation begins by locating likely exposure zones and confirming where freezing conditions affected the line. Diagnosis typically considers pipe routing, insulation gaps, and airflow pathways that can create localized cold surfaces. Once the affected segment is identified, the system is assessed for restriction, leakage indicators, and the condition of nearby joints and fittings that may have experienced the same expansion stress.

    <p>
      Repair scope commonly includes restoring the damaged section, validating connections under normal operating pressure, and applying stabilization measures that reduce repeat exposure. When a line runs through a finished wall or ceiling, access and restoration planning becomes part of the technical workflow, alongside leak detection and verification.

  <section aria-label="Technical standards and local context">
    <h2>Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
    <p>
      Plumbing repairs that involve permanent system changes, rerouting, protective enclosures, or modifications to building penetrations are expected to align with local permitting and inspection practices. Documentation that describes the work performed and the conditions addressed supports inspection readiness and helps ensure durability under normal operating conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A formal reference for building and inspection context in Folsom is maintained by the city:
